use `npx hardhat help` for help
use `npx hardhat test` to execute the test script. 

To deploy contract locally, its required to create a local Ethereum network by starting a local node.
To start a local node, run `npx hardhat node`

After the local node has been successfully started, execute `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost`
